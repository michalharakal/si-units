# Releasing
From the experience of the first months of the project a modified 
version numbering strategy instead of pure semantic versioning is selected. 
Namely, the third component of the version number (so called path) 
is incremented at each build. When increasing major number or minor number 
the path number is manually set to 0.

Entries in the ReleaseNotes are entered accordingly.

A fully tested version is published once.

The libraries (JVM and JS) and individual apps are numbered separately.
