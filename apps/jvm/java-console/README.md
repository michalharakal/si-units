# KotUniL - Java Console Demo Application


This demo demonstrate the use of **KotUniL** library in a console application developed with Java tests available in library objects and functions.
You can learn about functions and objects of **KotUniL** library in central [.../si-units/README.md](https://github.com/vsirotin/si-units/blob/8a4c1406be962031dd32724470fd15367c230e5d/README.md).
You can learn examples of using the library in Java-Console in [.../si-units/apps/jvm/java-console/src/main/java/eu/sirotin/kotunil/app/java/Main.java](https://github.com/vsirotin/si-units/blob/c3b2e195d7da0be8b2f5ef60b71c2c364b2eb562/apps/jvm/java-console/src/main/java/eu/sirotin/kotunil/app/java/Main.java).

## How to start console application
You can start the application directly in your IDE (e.g. IntelliJ) 
using the function main() in the file [Main.java](https://github.com/vsirotin/si-units/blob/c3b2e195d7da0be8b2f5ef60b71c2c364b2eb562/apps/jvm/java-console/src/main/java/eu/sirotin/kotunil/app/java/Main.java) 
or build the application and then start Jar from **build/libs**.

On success the application will show in the console the text:

**Test successfully completed!**

and number of tested objects and executed tests. 

## How to properly write KotUniL's formulas
KotUniL is a multiplatform library.
You can read about how to properly write physics and other formulas 
using the objects and functions of the KotUniL library in document
["Rules for writing KotUniL formulas in different programming languages"](https://github.com/vsirotin/si-units/blob/c3f1b87c2fa4b35adc64b676318e27eae3e246e5/RulesWritingFormulas.md).
